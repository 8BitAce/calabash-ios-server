DOCUMENTATION COMING
--------------------


## master branch contains the 0.10.x line. 
This is intended to be integrated into the Frank project, although unfortunately for various reasons I've not been able to work on this recently. It should build however.

## the calabash-ios-server branch is the 0.9.x line
This is Calabash as is currently used. The easiest way to build is to checkout calabash-ios-server and calabash-ios
(client) and look at the Rakefile inside calabash-ios/calabash-cucumber. Alternatively just build from xcode.
